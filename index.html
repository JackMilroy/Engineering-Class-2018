      <h2>  My name is Jack Milroy, and I'm a junior at Mayfield High School</h2>             
      <p>                              An endearing paragraph about me... I swim for Mayfield High Shool, 
      and I've been swimming since I was nine years old. I'm not the best at swimming, but I come out on top some of the time
      in the sprinting races. Every summer I go to my cabin in Canada on an island called Qui-Vive, which means "lookout". The picture below is 
      me jumping off of the dock playing football up there. </p>
